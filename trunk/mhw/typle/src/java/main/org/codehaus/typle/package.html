Provides a collection of classes that can be used to model types and
type systems. The package provides the following services to its
clients:
<ul>
<li>Representation of data types, such as Java primitives, records
and functions.
<li>Naming services, allowing data types to be found by name.
</ul>

<h2>Type Model</h2>

<p>
Types are modelled as instances of the {@link Type} interface.
Classes that implement this interface are expected to be
immutable, making it easy to use them in applications.
They must also correctly implement the {@link Object#equals}
and {@link Object#hashcode} methods.

<p>
All types have a <i>type name</i>, returned by the
{@link Type#getTypeName} method.
For some types this name will be the name that the type is
known by within an existing type system.
For example, the {@link JavaPrimitive} instances have names that
are the same as the corresponding Java primitive types.
Other types may not have meaningful names within an existing
type system, and so their <code>getTypeName</code> methods cannot
be expected to return values that are useful in other contexts.
For these types the <code>getTypeName</code> method is similar to the
<code>toString</code> method.
{@link Function} returns a value that describes the signature of
the function (its formal parameters and return type), for example.

<h2>Bindings</h2>

<p>
A {@link Binding} is the association of a name with a type in some
namespace.
This general concept is used in a number of places in the
data model:
for example, a {@link RecordType} is a collection of bindings
between field names and their types,
while {@link Function} formal parameters are bindings between
formal parameters and their types.

<h2>Naming</h2>

<p>
<code>typle</code> provides a naming service that can be used
to find types by name.
A type name has two parts, a <i>namespace</i> and a local part.
The namespace is a short string,
such as <code>"java"</code> or <code>"xsd"</code>.
The syntax of the local part varies between namespaces.

<p>
Not all types will have names, and so not all types can be
accessed through the naming service.
In general, a type that has been found through the naming service
should have a name (as returned by {@link Type#getTypeName}) that
is the local part of the name it was found by,
but this cannot be relied upon for all data types.
For example, a record might have field that is of an unnamed type,
and which is not accessible through the naming system.
