These are just some notes to improve Marmalade.

[jdcasey 6/24/2004]:
* Provide named scopes for context.set/getVariable(). 
    - This would allow tags to purposefully set a variable in an outer
      scope
    
    - This would also imply that certain scope names have a meaning
      which is separate from the actual layering involved 
      (eg. a named scope of "parent" might always mean this-1 scope).
