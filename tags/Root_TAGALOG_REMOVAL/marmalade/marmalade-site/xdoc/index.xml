      Marmalade is the next generation in XML-based scripting languages.
      It was originally intended as a black-box replacement for the ailing 
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jelly">Jelly</a> project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marmalade is smaller, faster, and much more stable than its 
      predecessor.
