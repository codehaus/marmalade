<h1>To Do</h1>
<p>
The following is a list of things that need to be done in typle.
Help is welcome!
</p>

<h1>Basic JavaBean generation</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Finish the Java source model so that it can create Java source
      files.</li>
  <li>Add code to ensure that existing source files are not overwritten
      unnecessarily - if the content has not changed then the timestamp
      should not change.</li>
  <li>Add support for creating type models from persistent storage.
      Initially this will probably mean reading XML files and creating
      objects from them. It'd be good to support other data sources
      though.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Type mapping</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Add a class to represent mappings from one type system to another.
      For example, a mapping from XML Schema types to Java types.</li>
  <li>Add support for reading mappings from persistent storage
      (probably XML in the first instance again).</li>
  <li>Add support for pushing types through a map as part of the
      code generation process.</li>
</ul>

<h1>SQL support</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Add a source model for SQL schema (tables).</li>
  <li>Consider adding support for SQL attributes in the type model.</li>
  <li>Extend tools to support generating SQL schema from types.</li>
  <li>Make sure SQL schema and JavaBean generation are consistent -
      an SQL schema and a JavaBean generated from a single
      type definition should be usable as the basis for a
      persistence layer, for example. Similaryly, the JavaBean should
      be usable as a data transfer object for a session bean that
      manipulates the corresponding table.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Namespaces</h1>
<p>
I'm thinking that type names should be considered to exist within
a namespace. For example <code>java:java.lang.String</code>,
<code>xsd:string</code> and <code>sql:char</code>. This will
come in handy when trying to create new instances - I suspect
that typle will sprout some kind of generic factory mechanism
which can instantiate types from different namespaces.
